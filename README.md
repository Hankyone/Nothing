> "In a world full of something, be Nothing."

## 🌟 Why Nothing?

After extensive research into NoCode solutions, we realized they were still doing too much. Nothing™ takes it further by:

- **Zero Dependencies**: Other frameworks claim to have no dependencies. We don't even depend on existence.
- **Infinitely Scalable**: Nothing scales better than Nothing.
- **100% Bug-Free**: It's impossible to have bugs when you have no code.
- **Cross-Platform**: Nothing works equally well on all platforms by working on none of them.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
$ npm install nothing
npm ERR! 404 Not Found: nothing@latest
```

Perfect! You're already using Nothing.
