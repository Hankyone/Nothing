# Security Policy for Nothing™

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Thank you for your interest in Nothing's security. However, we must inform you that reporting security vulnerabilities in Nothing is impossible for the following reasons:

### Why Nothing is Perfectly Secure

1. **No Code = No Vulnerabilities**
   - You can't exploit code that doesn't exist
   - No functions to hijack
   - No variables to overflow
   - No dependencies to poison

2. **Attack Surface: Zero**
   ```
   Attack Surface = Code × Complexity × Dependencies
                  = 0 × 0 × 0
                  = 0
   ```

3. **Security Through Absence**
   - No authentication (nothing to authenticate)
   - No authorization (nothing to authorize)
   - No encryption (nothing to encrypt)
   - No data (nothing to steal)

## Security Measures

### Input Validation
Nothing accepts no input, therefore:
- ✓ 100% protection against SQL injection
- ✓ 100% protection against XSS
- ✓ 100% protection against CSRF
- ✓ 100% protection against everything

### Data Protection
Nothing stores no data:
- No passwords to leak
- No personal information to expose
- No secrets to reveal
- No logs to analyze

*"The only truly secure system is one that is powered off, cast in a block of concrete and sealed in a lead-lined room with armed guards. Nothing achieves this level of security without the concrete, lead, or guards."* - Gene Spafford (paraphrased)
